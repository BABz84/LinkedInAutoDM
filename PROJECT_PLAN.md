# LinkedIn Auto-Messenger: Project Plan & Status

**Objective:** Evolve the prototype into a reliable, "no-fuss" application for automated customer outreach that minimizes the risk of account suspension by mimicking human behavior.

## Phase 0: Project Setup & Documentation
*   **Objective:** Ensure the project is easy to set up, configure, and understand.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [x] **Task 0.1: Enhance README:** Update `README.md` with clear, step-by-step instructions for installation, configuration (including setting up the `.env` file), and execution. - Approved by Brian
    *   [x] **Task 0.2: Secure Credential Management:** Implemented `auth.py` to handle login via `.env` file and create a session cookie. - Approved by Brian
    *   [x] **Task 0.3: Create Health Check Script:** Repurposed `selftest.py` into a simple script that verifies configuration, checks for a valid session cookie, and confirms database connectivity. - Approved by Brian

## Phase 1: Foundational Improvements (The "No-Fuss" Core)
*   **Objective:** Make the application stable and easy to manage.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [x] **Task 1.1: Centralized Configuration:** Consolidated all operational parameters into `config.py` and verified that dependent scripts use it correctly. - Approved by Brian
    *   [x] **Task 1.2: Robust Session Management:** Modified `voyager.py` and `send.py` to use the session cookie from `session.cookie`, removing the need for manual environment variable setup or pre-existing browser sessions. - Approved by Brian
    *   [x] **Task 1.3: Database Integration:** Refined `db.py` with an explicit setup function and updated all scripts to use a consistent connection method. The system continues to prevent duplicate messages. - Approved by Brian

## Phase 2: Advanced Human Heuristics & Reliable Interactions
*   **Objective:** Make the bot's behavior less detectable and more reliable.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [x] **Task 2.1: Implement "Working Hours":** Added a feature to `config.py` to define a time window for the bot to operate. The `send.py` script now respects these hours. - Approved by Brian
    *   [x] **Task 2.2: Dynamic Throttling & Actions:** Enhanced the sleep logic with more varied delays and added a human-like scrolling action before sending a message. - Approved by Brian
    *   [x] **Task 2.3: Reliable Element Interaction (WebDriverWait):** Verified that all UI element interactions use `WebDriverWait` for reliability. Intentional `time.sleep()` calls for human-like throttling remain. - Approved by Brian
    *   [x] **Task 2.4: Dynamic Message Templating:** Enhanced the existing templating system by adding a new example template and documenting the process in the README. - Approved by Brian

## Phase 3: Resilient Error Handling & Monitoring
*   **Objective:** Ensure the tool handles problems gracefully and provides clear feedback.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [x] **Task 3.1: Intelligent Checkpoint/CAPTCHA Detection:** Implemented robust error handling in `send.py` to detect security checkpoints and other common Selenium exceptions, logging descriptive statuses and halting execution when necessary. - Approved by Brian
    *   [x] **Task 3.2: Daily Summary Report:** Created a `reporter.py` script to generate a daily summary of activities and integrated it into the main `send.py` workflow. - Approved by Brian
